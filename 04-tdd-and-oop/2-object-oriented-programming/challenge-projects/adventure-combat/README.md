# Adventure Part 2 - Combat

This was a tricky project, because you are stepping in to existing code rather than writing your own. A big part of this project is spending some time familiarizing yourself with the code enough to be able to fix it and complete the non-existent methods.

When you first start, you'll run tests and start building out the methods according to the tests. That will work for a while, but at some point you may be able to pass the tests and still have a non-functional game. The key lies in the act() and rest() methods.

If you get towards the end of the project and get an odd bug about setTimeout, make sure to read through https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout, especially the "The 'this' problem".
